## Write Up

<!--- Final project write up goes here --->

A Large chunk of the canvas part of the project is still incomplete. Dragging and dropping isn’t in, creating text blocks and editing them is not complete. As well as the back end and inserting into the database is not complete as well. I’ve done all the investigating that I needed to already. The rest of it should just be implementing what I’ve learned. I had a prototype of mobile functionality prior with an unstable version of an infinite canvas drawing, zooming, and dragging the screen around. Ideally it won’t be hard to implement the entirety of that on mobile. I’m challenged with time outside of the final project right now. My dad has recently passed and there are a bunch of things that need to happen right now. I’m not particularly struggling on the project itself right now. I think once time frees up for me I should blow through it.
