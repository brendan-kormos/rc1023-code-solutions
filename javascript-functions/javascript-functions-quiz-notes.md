## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  assigning a block of code to a name to be used whenever, often created with parameters to allow for more dynamic use

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  it has a function keyword, optional name, parenthesis for parameters separated by commas, outside of the parenthesis, a code block opened with curly braces, an optional return statement, the code block is then closed with curly braces.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  you type the name of the function or access the variable holding the function and use parenthesis to call it, you pass in any values within the parenthesis.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  when you define a function, you're creating a block of functional code but it isn't being used yet. when you call a function, you are running the code within the function along with any arguments you pass into the function, you will receive a return value at the end. If a return wasn't specified, undefined will be returned.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  parameters are used when defining the function and are the names you've given to variables specific to your function. arguments are the actual values passed into the function when you call it, these are the parameters seen inside the function when defining

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  allows for dynamic and locallized use of a function

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  it gives a new value to the function when it's called, it also stops the code from running any deeper into the function
